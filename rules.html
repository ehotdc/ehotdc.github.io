        <h1>RULES</h1>
        <p>Yes, you of course have to abide by rules in this CTF. TL;DR: <b>be nice, don't not be nice.</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will need to participate in teams. 3-4 persons.</li>
            <li>The event requires physical attendance for the majority of the team. (3 person teams may have 1 remote player, 4 person teams may have 2).</li>
            <li>All on-site participants are required to secure a ticket for the event, this is free and done through cyberskills and eventbrite.</li>
            <li>Teams are prohibited from sharing flags with other teams. Please just don't do it.</li>
            <li>Do not attack the competition's infrastructure, don't attack CTFd etc.</li>
            <li>Don't attack other teams challenge instances.</li>
            <li>Unless specified, do not attempt to perform container/vm escapes.</li>
            <li>If you discover a mistake in a challenge or the infrastructure, please contact us.</li>
            <li>The winning team is determined by the highest points scored at the end of the competition. If more than 1 team is at the top of the scoreboard, then the time of scoring is used to determine the winner.</li>
            <li>When at the venue, please do not leave the designated areas. We perform our own physical penetration tests, we don't need outside help :-) .</li>
